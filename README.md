KNOH
====

KNOH is a fan open-source project to implement and expand on the mechanics used in the freeware game *KOHCTPYKTOP: Engineer of the People* by [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/play-kohctpyktop/).
It is written in C++ on top of SFML and the name is completely arbitrary with no meaning whatsoever.
The aim of the project is to produce a sandbox experience in which players can design and share both circuits and challenges.

Any and all contributions to the project are welcome and much appreciated.
