#####What's in a Kohctpryktop cell?

We'll take a first step here to answering this. It will not, however, in itself, answer the question
>"How to (best) represent the contents of a Kohctpryktop design area?"

or even
>"How - *actually* - are the contents of a Kohctpryktop design area represented?"

(Ie: "What's the actual format used in the original game?")

In order to approach these two we will first take on a **cell-centric view on things** and see what possible states
("configurations") a single cell can be in. [TODO: "Imagine: build graphical rep with a 1000 or so pics"]
This explicitly includes any connections to neighbouring cells, hence there'd be a bit of redundancy if we 
were to use it in an encoding of an *array of cells*.

Anyways, a quite compact way of representing such a cell configuration is a regular expression ("regexp", for short), 
such as this:
```
(_|m[0-9A-F])(_|[np][0-9A-F]v?|((npn|pnp)(TB?|B|LR?|R))
```
*- giving a total of 17 &times; 77 = 1309 configurations; details following.*

Before the explanation let me state that: It
* is meant as a tool for analysis (as eg the # of different cell images, given certain conventions)
* should yield valid and fairly reasonable file names
* should be (somewhat) parseable by a human
* represents a **cell-centric view on things**, ie it's supposed to contain exactly the right amount of information to describe one cell completely; "stand-alone" (as by what can exist in the original game)
* does contain - when used in an encoding of an *array of cells* - redundant information
* is therefore probably NOT how things are encoded in the actual data format (see above, I reckon the actual thing is rather separating a) what's in the cell (m and/or silicon) and b) connections)

[TODO: completely incorporate all of these into intro text, then delete this bullet list]

The regexp decomposes into two main parts:
* metal layer and its connections: ``(_|m[0-9A-F])``
* silicon layer with variations and connections: ``(_|[np][0-9A-F]v?|((npn|pnp)(TB?|B|LR?|R))``

##### Metal layer
Pretty simple: either there is no metal (``_``) or there is (``m``). In the latter case there can exist connections
to any of four sides: top, right, bottom, left - which is encoded in 4 bits, represented as one hex digit (``[0-9A-F]``).
Which bit means which direction is up to convention. 
The one we'll use is TLBR, read MSB-to-LSB. That is: ``8`` = top, ``4`` = left, ``2`` = bottom, 1 = ``right``.

*The two alternatives yield a total of 1 + 16 = 17 configurations in the metal layer.*

##### Silicon layer
Here we got three alternatives:
* no silicon at all (``_``), hence no connections there ( *1 configuration* )
* simple negative or positive silicon (``[np]``) and if so: connections like in metal layer (``[0-9A-F]``) **plus** maybe a via (``v?``) (*2 &times; 16 &times; 2 = 64 configurations*)
* or a junction - that's the tricky one ( *a total of 12 configurations, detailed below* )

*As by the above, there are a total of 1 + 64 + 12 = 77 configurations in the silicon layer.*

A junction then is further detailed like so:
* ``(npn|pnp)``, obvious ( *&times; 2 wrt nr of configurations* ). But plz note that ``npn`` 1st of all (but not only) implies 2 *normal* **N**-silicon connections while ``pnp`` implies 2 *normal* **P**-silicon connections (ie. the "collector" and "emitter" connections)
* ``(TB?|B|LR?|R)`` ( *&times; 6 wrt nr of configurations* ): this is to encode both, 
  * a) horizontal vs vertical orientation of the ``npn`` or ``pnp`` sequence as a whole
  * b) AND, as a junction implies * **at least one** connection from a neighbouring cell **to the middle part** * (ie the "base" connection) - which of them are present. ``T`` (Top), ``B`` (Bottom), ``L`` (Left) and ``R`` (Right) encode which neighbour relative to the middle part is connected (implying, of course, that same sort of silicon in that neighbour as in the middle part).

Note that ``(TB?|B|LR?|R)`` actually encodes a subset of the connections that we used to otherwise encode by ``[0-9A-F]``.
We could therefore as well use ``[8|A|2|4|5|1]`` here.
However, we chose ``(TB?|B|LR?|R)`` instead because it seems a little bit simpler (for a human).

Here are some examples for the junction part:
* ``npnT`` encodes 
  * a **horizontal** junction (thereby implying simple ``n`` on the left and right)
  * plus the **top** neighbour being simple ``p`` and connected to the ``p`` "base".
       But the **bottom neighbour is NOT** connected and can have whatever silicon (incl. none) whatsoever.
* ``pnpLR`` encodes
  * a **vertical** junction (thereby implying simple ``p`` on the top and bottom)
  * plus the **left and right** neighbour being simple ``n`` and connected to the ``n`` "base".
* ``npnR`` encodes 
  * a **vertical** junction (thereby implying simple ``n`` on the top and bottom)
  * plus the **right** neighbour being simple ``p`` and connected to the ``p`` "base".
       But the **left neighbour is NOT** connected and can have whatever silicon (incl. none) whatsoever.
* ``pnpRL`` is illegal
* ... as is ``npnBT``
* ... or ``npnTBv``
* ...
